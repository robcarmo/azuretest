CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

1. Build and Push Docker Image
This workflow is triggered by pushes to the main branch. It performs the following steps:

Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
Set Up Docker: Configures Docker Buildx for building multi-platform images.
Login to Azure: Authenticates with Azure using the credentials set up in the GitHub repository secrets.
Login to ACR: Authenticates with Azure Container Registry.
Build and Push Docker Image: Builds the Docker image for the sample API and pushes it to ACR.

2. Deploy to AKS
This workflow is triggered by pushes to the main branch. It performs the following steps:

Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
Login to Azure: Authenticates with Azure using the credentials set up in the GitHub repository secrets.
Set Up kubectl: Configures kubectl to interact with the AKS cluster.
Get AKS Credentials: Retrieves the AKS cluster credentials to configure kubectl.
Deploy to AKS: Uses Helm to deploy the sample API to the AKS cluster, referencing the Docker images stored in ACR.
Deployment Process
Build and Push Docker Image:

The CI workflow builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the docker/api/ directory.
The built image is tagged and pushed to Azure Container Registry.
Deploy to AKS:

The CD workflow retrieves the latest image from ACR.
Helm is used to deploy the application to the AKS cluster, applying configurations specified in the Helm chart located in helm/sample-api/.

Summary

The CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions to automate the build, push, and deployment processes. Docker images are built and pushed to ACR, and the application is deployed to AKS using Helm charts. This setup ensures a streamlined and automated workflow for deploying updates to the sample API, with all necessary configurations and secrets managed securely within GitHub and Azure.


Deployment and CI/CD Explanation
Deployment Steps
Step 1: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

Initialize Terraform to set up the working directory for configuration files.
Plan the infrastructure deployment, allowing review of the execution plan.
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the necessary infrastructure, including the AKS cluster, ACR, and other components.
Step 2: Build and Push Docker Image to ACR

Build the Docker image for the sample API from the Dockerfile in the specified directory.
Login to Azure Container Registry to authenticate Docker with ACR.
Push the built Docker image to ACR for storage and later deployment.
Step 3: Deploy Application to AKS with Helm

Package the Helm chart to prepare it for deployment.
Install the Helm chart to deploy the sample API to the AKS cluster.
Upgrade the deployment using Helm if there are updates to the application.
Verify the deployment to ensure everything is running correctly.
CI/CD Pipeline Explanation
Build and Push Docker Image

This workflow builds a Docker image for the sample API and pushes it to ACR. It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and performs the following steps:
Checkout the latest code from the repository.
Set up Docker Buildx for multi-platform image builds.
Authenticate with Azure and ACR.
Build and push the Docker image to ACR.
Deploy to AKS

This workflow deploys the Docker image to AKS using Helm. It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and performs the following steps:
Checkout the latest code from the repository.
Authenticate with Azure.
Configure kubectl to interact with the AKS cluster.
Retrieve AKS cluster credentials to configure kubectl.
Deploy the sample API to the AKS cluster using Helm.
Testing Steps
1. Access the Application

Retrieve the service details to get the external IP address.
Open a web browser and navigate to the external IP address to access the application.
2. Verify Pod Status

Check the status of the pods to ensure they are running correctly.
If any pods are not running correctly, check the logs for troubleshooting.
3. Run Automated Tests

Define and run tests locally to verify application functionality.
Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing after deployment.
Summary
This deployment process ensures that your sample API is built, pushed, and deployed in a streamlined manner using Terraform, Docker, and Helm. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment steps, leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Testing steps include verifying the application via the public IP, ensuring all pods are running correctly, and integrating automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. This setup allows for efficient and scalable application deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service.

Note: All secrets required for GitHub and Kubernetes manifests are not included in this documentation due to time restrictions, but they should be considered a critical part of this work.
