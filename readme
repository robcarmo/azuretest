User Story
As a DevOps Engineer, I want to deploy a sample API with multiple replicas and its associated database using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), ensuring best practices in deployment, security, and performance, so that the application is accessible to users while the database remains secure and optimized.

Epic
Epic: Deploy Sample API and Database on AKS
Tasks:
Define Infrastructure with Terraform
